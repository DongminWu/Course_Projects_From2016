@article{Suresh2016,
abstract = {Motivated by the need for distributed learning and optimization algorithms with low communication cost, we study communication efficient algorithms for distributed mean estimation. Unlike previous works, we make no probabilistic assumptions on the data. We first show that for {\$}d{\$} dimensional data with {\$}n{\$} clients, a naive stochastic binary rounding approach yields a mean squared error (MSE) of {\$}\backslashTheta(d/n){\$} and uses a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We then extend this naive algorithm in two ways: we show that applying a structured random rotation before quantization reduces the error to {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}((\backslashlog d)/n){\$} and a better coding strategy further reduces the error to {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(1/n){\$} and uses a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We also show that the latter coding strategy is optimal up to a constant in the minimax sense i.e., it achieves the best MSE for a given communication cost. We finally demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by applying them to distributed Lloyd's algorithm for k-means and power iteration for PCA.},

For quadratic objectives, the method enjoys a linear rate of convergence which provably $\backslash$emph{\{}improves{\}} with the data size, requiring an essentially constant number of iterations under reasonable assumptions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence of the advantages of our method compared to other approaches, such as one-shot parameter averaging and ADMM.},

@article{Zinkevich2010,
abstract = {With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the first parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique â€” contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8].},
